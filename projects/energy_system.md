### Project Overview
This project, under the guidance of Dr. Wei-Hsin Chen at NCKU's Green Energy and Fuel Laboratory (GENFUEL), aimed to design a hybrid system that generates both hot water and electricity. Using solar vacuum tubes and thermoelectric chips, the system increases energy efficiency by converting waste heat into electrical power. The project addresses the demand for sustainable energy solutions, especially in regions with high solar exposure, like South Taiwan.



### Methods and Implementation
*  **System Design:** Used **SolidWorks** to design the system and assembled components. Wrote embedded code with **C** for power detection, energy storage, and display.

* **Experimentation:** Conducted experiments to measure and improve power generation efficiency, both in simulated and real environments.

* **Monitoring:** Integrated an Arduino-based system to track power output in real time, storing generated energy in lithium batteries.

### Key Contributions and Achievements

* Demonstrated the feasibility of this experimental system through data analysis, identifying increased temperature difference as a key method for improving efficiency.

* Selected as one of 21 finalists out of 99 teams in the 2021 Energy Technology Creative Project Competition, organized by the National Science and Technology Museum, Taiwan.
