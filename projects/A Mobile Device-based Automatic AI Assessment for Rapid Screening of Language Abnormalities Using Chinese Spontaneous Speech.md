### Project Overview

<br />

This project aims to develop a mobile-device-based AI assessment tool for the rapid screening of language abnormalities, supporting streamlined follow-up with clinical diagnoses. Our team is divided into specialized groups, including an app development team, a Pixel phone integration team, and a psycholinguistic assessment team.

### Contributions 
As a backend engineer on the app development team, I was responsible for system design and collaborated with other teams to ensure seamless integration. My specific contributions include:

*  **Behavioral Data Collection**: Developed an automated preprocessing program in Python to enhance data handling efficiency.

* **System Design**:  Designed and implemented a speech data collection app and server infrastructure using Flutter and Flask.

* **Automatic Language Features Extraction & Analysis**: Integrated a linguistic feature extraction application, along with a classification model, within the mobile app.
