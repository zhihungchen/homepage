### Project Overview

<br />

This project focuses on creating a memory aid mobile application specifically for patients at Dr. Ming-Jang Chiu’s cognitive clinic. The app is designed to improve the quality of life for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by providing a convenient way to remember important information through natural conversations. Initially created as an Android prototype, the app has now been expanded to support both iOS and Android, making it accessible to a wider audience through app stores.


### Features 

*  **Voice-based Event Recording**: Users, including patients and caregivers, can easily record events using their voice through the app’s ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) feature.

* **Event Retrieval via Conversation**: Once events are recorded, users can start a conversation with the system to actively retrieve and review important events.

* **Calendar Integration & Notifications**: The application syncs with users’ Google Calendar accounts to help organize events. It also triggers notifications for upcoming events directly on users’ devices.


### Skills and Contributions

* Frontend: Developed the cross-platform functionality using Flutter, enabling compatibility across both iOS and Android.
* Backend and Server: Managed account operations using PHP and implemented event retrieval functionality through Python servers, where I took on maintenance responsibilities.
* User experience: Collected and analyzed user experience data from real patients at the clinic to inform app improvements and usability.
