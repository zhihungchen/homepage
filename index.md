<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>

<h3>
Hi! I'm CHIH-HUNG (Andrew) CHEN. Welcome to my personal page!
</h3>

<p>
Iâ€™m currently a research assistant at the <a href="http://ai.robo.ntu.edu.tw/en/index.php">Center for Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Robotics</a> at National Taiwan University. My research spans robotics, AI, and healthcare applications, with a focus on <b>human-robot interaction</b> and <b>social robotics</b>. With hands-on experience in embedded system design, healthcare robotics development, and mobile and cross-platform application engineering, I am passionate about harnessing technology to enhance quality of life for all.
</p>
<p>
<p>
Before joining NTU, I was a part-time research assistant at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) under Professor Ya-Ning Chang, where I developed a cross-platform language screening app using Flutter and managed backend data processing with Python and MongoDB for NLP research.
